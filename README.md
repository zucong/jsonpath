# jsonpath
jsonpath is a implementation of http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/. 

Considering that most jsonpath parsers implemented in go language do not support modification of json objects, I wrote this.

The most useful feature is that it can support the modification of the original json object. For detail usage, please read the test case.
